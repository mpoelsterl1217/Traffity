# Traffity

## Current Prototype
Traffity is an app that analyzes driver behavior in order to enable drivers to better their driving. 
It currently analyzes acceleration data for harsh brakes and accelerations. 

## Next Steps
The current prototype needs to be finished, specifically in storing the trips and displaying them in the TableView. 
From there, the project should expand to analyze more axes of the accelerometer data and other data sources in order to gain better insights on the driver's behavior.
